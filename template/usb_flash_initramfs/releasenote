This release can be used to flash the spi nor flash through USB Drive, or 
to flash the emmc.

After system start-up, the power led state is white & slow blink;

The script will first check if device file for usb drive (/dev/sda1) exists,
if not, power led turns off. SATA/PATA drivers are removed from kernel configuration,
so hard drive won't be recognized by kernel.

Then it try to mount /dev/sda1, if this fails, power led state is set to orange, 
fast blink.

After that, it checks if spi_nor.bin or emmc.img file exist on usb, if neither file 
exist, the power led turns to orange, slow blink.

Later on, the script put power led to white, fast blink, indicating it is flashing 
the spi nor flash or emmc. Only one operation is performed, depending on which 
image file exists on usb drive. If both files exists, only spi nor is flashed.

Finally, if the operation succeeds, power led turns to white, on. Otherwise, it
turns orange, on, indicating an error.
